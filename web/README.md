### About
Booklit is a cross-platform audiobook player for Plex Media Server.

### Plex Setup
I recommend you flow [this](https://github.com/seanap/Plex-Audiobook-Guide) guid for getting metadata to show up properly in Booklit.

### Web App
The plexlit web app is hosted at [plexlit.web.app](https://plexlit.web.app). if you want to self host the web app download the self-hosted version and run it with any web server (Nginx, live-server, ext...) make sure your server is configured to allow CROSS origin request for plex.tv & plex.direct.

### Android 
Booklit will be available on google play soon. It can also be download directly from the included download links.

### Linux 
The Linux versions of Booklit currently crashes when trying to play audio. 

### Future Plans
- Jellyfin Support
- Windows port
